# Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction

A machine learning solution to predict cervical cancer risk using Python.

## Overview

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle to develop predictive models for cervical cancer risk. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: imputation, normalization, and encoding
- Data visualization: boxplots, heatmaps, and confusion matrices
- Machine learning models: KNN and SVM
- Performance optimization: PCA and SMOTE

## Technologies

- Python
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results

Achieved up to 84% accuracy using KNN and SVM models.
